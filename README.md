## Mission
#### Build great products for real people.  
Products people love to use, that make life easier, and that either bring joy in the foreground or disappear into the background but would be profoundly disruptive if removed.  

### Vision
#### A world where product teams build with **clarity, accountability, and speed**, creating products that deliver real impact without unnecessary complexity or sacrificing trust.

## Principles

#### Momentum is a discipline
Progress doesn’t come from heroic sprints or chaotic bursts. It comes from steady, predictable momentum. The best teams build systems that keep moving forward even under pressure.  

#### Clarity beats consensus
Consensus often slows teams down or hides hard truths. Clarity — knowing exactly what we’re doing, why, and who owns it — unlocks speed and trust.  

#### Execution matters more than ideas
The world is full of ideas. Execution is what separates teams that talk from teams that deliver.  

#### Predictability and quality build trust
Customers, teams, and leaders rely on the predictable delivery of quality products. Predictability builds confidence; quality builds trust.  

#### Health is non-negotiable
Products don’t succeed if the people building them are burning out or cutting ethical corners. Sustainable pace and principled leadership always come first.

## Working With Me

### What I Value
- **Clarity over consensus.** Clear direction beats endless agreement.  
- **Execution discipline.** I admire people who follow through and deliver.  
- **Principled action.** Compliance, trust, and ethics are non-negotiable.  
- **Creativity in constraints.** The best solutions often come from limits.  
- **Accountability.** People and teams should own outcomes, not just activity.  

### How I Work Best
- **Reflection time.** I need time to process complex decisions before committing.  
- **Variety.** I thrive on new challenges, not repetitive busywork.  
- **Autonomy.** I want space to design the system, then run it.  
- **Direct feedback.** Respectful but candid feedback helps me improve.  

### What to Expect From Me
- **Direct communication.** Clear and straightforward — sometimes blunt, always respectful.  
- **High energy, high standards.** I push hard for results but pace for sustainability.  
- **Support under pressure.** I won’t ask someone to do what I wouldn’t.  
- **Curiosity.** I’ll ask a lot of questions to diagnose and learn.  
- **Resilience.** I’ve worked through crises and will bring steadiness when things get rough.  

### Things That Drain Me
- **Politics and gamesmanship.** Hidden agendas kill trust.  
- **Over-scheduling.** I need space between commitments to think and recharge.  
- **Disrespect.** I can be direct, but I expect mutual respect. I will give it, and I need it in return.  
- **Stalled execution.** Talking in circles without action is frustrating.  
- **Rigid systems.** I like structure, but I also need flexibility in how I work.  

### Collaboration Tips
- **Be concise.** Short, clear communication beats long-winded explanations.  
- **Bring data or examples.** Don’t just tell me something’s broken—show me.  
- **Respect time.** Come prepared, don’t wing it.  
- **Challenge ideas, not people.** Push me if it makes the product better.  
- **Don’t wait.** If you’re blocked, raise it early — I’d rather know than be surprised later.
