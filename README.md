- 👋 Hi, I’m @corybagozzi; product manager, problem solver, technology strategist
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about JAMStack and headless ecosystems. My expertise is in product and design, I play around with coding and development to understand enough to be able to hold my own in meetings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NuxtJS and GraphQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something fun but so weird it could never be about making money, more artistic expression via technology.
- 📫 corybagozzi.com or corybagozzi@gmail.com
