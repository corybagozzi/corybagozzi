- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @corybagozzi; product manager, problem solver, technology strategist
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about JAMStack and headless ecosystems. My expertise is in product and design, I play around with coding and development to understand enough to be able to hold my own in meetings.
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m currently learning NuxtJS and GraphQL
- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something fun but so weird it could never be about making money, more artistic expression via technology.
