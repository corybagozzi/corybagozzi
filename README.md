- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @corybagozzi; product manager, problem solver, technology strategist

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Machine Learning and how to better leverage AI. My expertise is in product and design, I play around with coding and development to understand enough to be able to hold my own in meetings.

- ğŸ§  I think a lot about how to make tedious tasks automated.

- ğŸš€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate.
